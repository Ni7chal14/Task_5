Elevate Labs Internship Task-5 30th June 2025

I trained a Decision Tree and a Random Forest model on a heart disease dataset to predict whether a person has heart disease or not. I started by visualizing the decision tree to understand how it's making decisions. Then, I checked for overfitting by comparing an unpruned tree with a pruned tree (limited depth). After that, I trained a Random Forest, which gave better accuracy and generalization. I also analyzed which features were most important using a bar chart, and finally, I evaluated the model using cross-validation to ensure stable performance across different parts of the dataset.
